5. **(Optional) Save as Launcher**

     ‚úÖ **"Save Command as a Launcher"**
   - This creates a shortcut in Crossover so you don‚Äôt have to repeat this step every time.

   - The game should now launch inside the Crossover environment.
   - If it doesn‚Äôt start, double-check:
     - You selected the correct `.exe`

## üß© Tips & Notes

- **Performance**: On Apple Silicon, performance is generally good with medium settings.

- **Fixes**: If the game fails to launch, try running it in **Windows 7 mode** or adjusting bottle settings.
