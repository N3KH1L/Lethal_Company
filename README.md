### üß≠ A. Add the Game Executable

1. **Open Crossover**
   - Launch the Crossover app.

2. **Select Your Bottle**
   - In the sidebar, select the bottle you created earlier (e.g., `LethalCompany`).

3. **Click "Run Command..."**
   - This opens a window to run a custom `.exe` file.

4. **Browse for the Game File**
   - Click **"Browse..."** and navigate to the extracted folder.
   - Select the game's executable file:
     ```
     Lethal Company.exe
     ```

5. **(Optional) Save as Launcher**
   - Enable ‚úÖ **"Save Command as Launcher"** to create a shortcut in Crossover.

6. **Click "Run"**
   - The game should now launch inside the bottle.

### ‚öôÔ∏è B. Enable WinHTTP in Wine (Required for Online Play)

To ensure online/multiplayer functionality works correctly, you must manually enable the `winhttp` library in the bottle's Wine settings.

Follow these steps:

1. **Open Wine Configuration**
   - With your `LethalCompany` bottle selected, click the gear icon or right-click ‚Üí **"Wine Configuration"**

2. **Go to the "Libraries" Tab**
   - In the Wine Configuration window, switch to the **Libraries** tab.

3. **Add `winhttp`**
   - Under **"New override for library"**, type:
     ```
     winhttp
     ```
   - Click **"Add"**

4. **Confirm Override**
   - You should now see:
     ```
     winhttp (native, builtin)
     ```
   - If not, select it in the list and choose **"Edit"** to set it manually to **native, builtin**

5. **Click "Apply"**, then **"OK"**

---

> üß† Tip: If the game doesn‚Äôt launch or shows network-related errors, enabling `winhttp` typically resolves it. You can return to this setting any time via Wine Configuration.

---

## üéÆ Step 4: Run the Game

1. In Crossover, click the **"Run Command"** button inside your bottle
2. Click **"Browse..."**, and select the game‚Äôs `.exe` (e.g., `Lethal Company.exe`) from the extracted folder
3. (Optional) Check **"Save Command as Launcher"** to create a shortcut for future use
4. Click **"Run"**

---

## üß© Tips & Notes

- **Performance**: On Apple Silicon, performance is generally good with medium settings.
- **Multiplayer**: Online co-op may work if the repack supports it and required networking features are intact.
- **Fixes**: If the game fails to launch, try running it in **Windows 7 mode** or adjusting bottle settings.
